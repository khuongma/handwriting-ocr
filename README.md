Please import the following .jar items in the libraries file.
My program uses java swing as a GUI. Everything will work without going to console.

PLEASE WAIT MAX 15 SECONDS FOR MY METHODS TO ANALYZE YOUR HANDWRITING

Once you finish writing your note and click the analyze button it will save an image of your text and then it will be sent through the API for analysis. After that it will return a json file and go through the json reader method in which it has the results of the analysis. From the analysis it will show on the GUI.

Once you clear your note you cannot unclear it. Clicking the clear button will clear the entire screen.
